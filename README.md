# About

One of my projects from years ago build it on unity 3d was an rpg game as i remember its not complete though
The graphics aren't that great i think as i haven't really added much assets into the game
Can be taken as a learning material for a basic 3D unity project
Pretty old project haven't updated anything in a while
